/*
    Max Heap
    Description: A max heap is a complete binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children, ensuring the maximum element is at the root.
    Implementation Hint: Implement insertion and deletion while maintaining the heap property using a bottom-up or top-down approach.
