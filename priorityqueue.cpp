/*
    Priority Queue
    Description: A priority queue is an abstract data type similar to a regular queue or stack, but where each element has a priority associated with it. Elements with higher priority are served before those with lower priority.
    Implementation Hint: Use a binary heap (min-heap or max-heap) to efficiently manage and retrieve elements based on their priority.
